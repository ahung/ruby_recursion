ruby_recursion
==============
Various methods written in Ruby that are all recursive (or at least have both a recursive and iterative version).  

Range - Given a start and finish number, it returns an array of numbers in between the start to the finish (inclusive).  

Iterative Sum - Given an array of numbers, returns the sum of the array iteratively.  

Recursive Sum - Same as above but with recursion.    

Exponent 1 - Given a base and power, returns the base to that power recursively.  

Exponent 2 - Same as above but is logarithmic.   

Deep Dup - Given an array (with possibly more nested arrays), returns a duplicated copy of the array and nested arrays with recursion.  

Iterative Fibonacci - Given a number (n), returns an array of first n fibonacci numbers iteratively.  

Recursive Fibonacci - Same as above but with recursion.  

Binary Search - Given a sorted array and a target, recursively search for the target via binary search algorithm. Returns index if found or nil if not.  

Make Change - Given a current amount (currency optional, default is U.S. coins), recursively find and return an array of change that uses the least amount of coins.  

Merge Sort - Utilizes recursion and a helper method to apply merge sort algorithm to the given array and return the sorted array.  

Subsets - Given an array, recursively create and return an array of all the subsets.
